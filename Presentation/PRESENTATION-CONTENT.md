## Slide 2: Introduction - The Need for Secure Authentication

### Why Face Verification?

**Traditional Authentication Problems:**
- Passwords: Forgotten, stolen, phished (60% of breaches)
- OTPs: SIM swapping, interception attacks
- Physical tokens: Lost, stolen, expensive

**Face Verification Advantages:**
- Non-intrusive (just look at camera)
- Cannot be forgotten or lost
- Fast authentication (15-50ms)
- Ubiquitous hardware (cameras everywhere)

**Real-World Impact:**
- Apple Face ID: Billions of authentications, 1 in 1,000,000 FAR
- Banking: 30-50% fraud reduction
- Airports: Automated gates, reduced wait times

---

## Slide 3: The Problem - Security Vulnerabilities

### Two Critical Attack Categories

**1. Presentation Attacks (Spoofing)**
- Photo attacks: Printed photos, phone displays (80% success rate)
- Video replay: Pre-recorded videos on tablets/laptops
- 3D masks: Physical masks from 3D scans

**2. Deepfake Attacks**
- Face swapping: Replace face in video (DeepFaceLab, FaceSwap)
- Face reenactment: Transfer expressions in real-time
- Synthetic faces: AI-generated fake identities

**The Core Issue:**
- Single-camera systems lack depth information
- Cannot distinguish 2D (photo/screen) from 3D (real face)
- Texture-based methods: Only 85-92% accuracy
- High false rejection rates (5-8%)

---

## Slide 4: Limitations of Existing Solutions

### Current Approaches Fall Short

| Approach | Accuracy | Cost | Limitation |
|----------|----------|------|------------|
| **Depth Sensors** | >98% | ₹15,000+ | Too expensive, not in consumer devices |
| **Texture-Based (LBP)** | 85-90% | Low | Fails on high-quality prints, 5-8% false rejection |
| **CNN Anti-Spoofing** | 92-95% | Medium | Poor generalization to new attacks |
| **Deepfake Detectors** | 90-95% | Medium | 70-80% on unseen methods |

**Fundamental Problems:**
- Single-camera architectural limitation
- Generalization failure to novel attacks
- Cost vs accuracy trade-off
- High computational requirements (GPU needed)

## Slide 5: Evolution - From Siamese Networks to ArcFace

### Why We're NOT Using Siamese Networks

**What are Siamese Networks?**
- Twin neural networks with shared weights
- Learn similarity by comparing face pairs
- Popular in 2015-2018 (FaceNet era)
- Used contrastive loss or triplet loss

**Why Industry Moved Away:**

| Aspect | Siamese Networks (2015) | ArcFace (2019) - Current Standard |
|--------|------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Accuracy** | 97-98% on LFW | **99.83% on LFW** |
| **Training** | Needs pairs/triplets (slow) | Direct classification (fast) |
| **Loss Function** | Contrastive/Triplet loss | Angular margin loss |
| **Mining** | Hard negative mining needed | No mining needed |
| **Convergence** | Slower, unstable | Faster, stable |

**Current Industry Standard:**
- **ArcFace** (Additive Angular Margin Loss)
- Used by: Apple Face ID, Alibaba, Tencent, InsightFace
- Better embeddings: More discriminative, better separated
- Easier deployment: Pre-trained models available

**Our Choice:**
- We'll use **ArcFace** for face verification (when we reach that stage)
- Pre-trained on millions of faces
- No need to train from scratch
- Industry-proven performance

**Key Takeaway:**
Siamese networks were important historically but have been superseded by better methods like ArcFace for production systems.

## Slide 6: Why NOT Siamese Networks?

### Critical Limitations for Our Use Case

**What We Need:**
- Real-time face verification (15-30 FPS)
- High accuracy (>99%)
- Easy deployment with pre-trained models
- Efficient training if needed

**Why Siamese Networks Don't Work:**

**1. Training Complexity**
- Requires pair/triplet generation (millions of pairs)
- Hard negative mining needed (computationally expensive)
- Slow convergence (100+ epochs typical)
- Unstable training (sensitive to hyperparameters)

**2. Lower Accuracy**
- Best Siamese: 97-98% on LFW
- Modern methods: 99.83% on LFW
- **2% accuracy gap = 200 more errors per 10,000 faces**

**3. Deployment Issues**
- No good pre-trained models available
- Would need to train from scratch
- Requires large dataset (millions of face pairs)
- Time-consuming: Weeks of training

**4. Outdated Architecture**
- Published in 2015 (9 years old)
- Superseded by better methods
- Not used in modern production systems
- No active development/support

**What We're Using Instead:**
- **ArcFace** for face verification
  - Pre-trained on millions of faces
  - 99.83% accuracy (industry standard)
  - Ready to use (no training needed)
  - Used by Apple, Alibaba, Tencent

**The Bottom Line:**
Siamese networks were important historically, but using them today would be like using a 2015 smartphone when 2024 models are available - technically possible but not practical.

## Slide 9: RetinaFace - Face Detection (Part 1)

### What is RetinaFace?

**Purpose:**
- Detect faces in images/video frames
- Locate 5 facial landmarks (eyes, nose, mouth corners)
- Essential first step for any face verification system

**Key Innovation:**
- Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) backbone
- Multi-scale detection: Finds faces from tiny (16×16) to large
- Joint multi-task learning:
  1. Face classification (face vs background)
  2. Bounding box regression (where is the face?)
  3. Five facial landmark localization (precise points)

**Why Landmarks Matter:**
- Enable face alignment before recognition
- Improves verification accuracy by 3-5%
- Needed for consistent face cropping

---

## Slide 10: RetinaFace - Performance Comparison (Part 2)

### Why RetinaFace is the Best Choice

**Performance Comparison:**

| Detector | Accuracy | Speed | Landmarks | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|-----------|-------|
| Haar Cascades | 85% | 5ms | ❌ No | Old method, fast but inaccurate |
| MTCNN | 92-94% | 50-80ms | ✅ Yes | Slow, 3-stage cascade |
| YOLO-Face | 94-95% | 10-15ms | ❌ No | Fast but no landmarks |
| **RetinaFace** | **97%** | **20-30ms** | ✅ **Yes (5)** | **Best balance** |

**Why We Selected RetinaFace:**
1. Highest accuracy: 97% on WIDER FACE benchmark
2. Provides precise 5 landmarks for alignment
3. Reasonable speed: 20-30ms per frame
4. Robust to occlusions and challenging lighting
5. Pre-trained models available (InsightFace library)

**Practical Benefits:**
- No training needed (use pre-trained model)
- Works on various face sizes and angles
- Reliable in real-world conditions

## Slide 11: EfficientNet-B0 - Deepfake Detection (Part 1)

### The Compound Scaling Innovation

**Traditional CNN Scaling Problem:**
- Want better accuracy? Make network deeper OR wider OR higher resolution
- But which one? How much?
- Random scaling is inefficient

**EfficientNet's Solution: Compound Scaling**
- Scale depth, width, AND resolution together
- Use compound coefficient φ to balance all three

**Compound Scaling Formula:**
```
depth:      d = α^φ    (number of layers)
width:      w = β^φ    (number of channels)
resolution: r = γ^φ    (image size)

Constraint: α × β² × γ² ≈ 2
```

**Why This Works:**
- Balanced scaling is more efficient than scaling one dimension
- Achieves better accuracy with fewer parameters
- Optimized through neural architecture search

**EfficientNet-B0 Basics:**
- Baseline model with φ=1
- Input: 224×224 RGB images
- Uses MBConv blocks (mobile inverted bottleneck)
- 7 stages with squeeze-and-excitation attention

## Slide 12: EfficientNet-B0 - Efficiency Comparison (Part 2)

### Best Accuracy-Efficiency Trade-off

**Performance Comparison:**

| Model | Parameters | FLOPs | ImageNet Top-1 | Our Use Case |
|-------|------------|-------|----------------|--------------|
| ResNet-50 | 25.6M | 4.1B | 76.0% | Too large |
| XceptionNet | 23M | 8.4B | - | Very slow |
| MobileNetV2 | 3.5M | 0.3B | 72.0% | Less accurate |
| **EfficientNet-B0** | **5.3M** | **0.39B** | **77.1%** | **Perfect!** |

**Key Advantages:**
- **5× fewer parameters** than ResNet-50
- **10× fewer FLOPs** than ResNet-50
- **Better accuracy** than all of them
- Enables **CPU inference** (15-20 FPS possible)

**For Deepfake Detection:**
- Fine-tune on FaceForensics++ dataset
- Binary classification: Real vs Deepfake
- Expected accuracy: 94-95%
- Training time: 2-4 hours on GPU

**Why This Matters:**
- Can run on standard laptops (no GPU needed for inference)
- Small model size enables edge deployment
- Fast enough for real-time video processing

---

## Slide 13: EfficientNet Training Strategy

### Transfer Learning Approach

**Training Pipeline:**

**Step 1: Start with Pre-trained Model**
- Use ImageNet pre-trained EfficientNet-B0
- Already knows general visual features:
  - Edges, textures, shapes, colors
  - Basic object recognition patterns

**Step 2: Modify for Our Task**
- Remove: 1000-class ImageNet classifier
- Add: Binary classifier (Real vs Deepfake)
- Keep: All convolutional layers

**Step 3: Freeze Early Layers**
- Early layers: Generic low-level features
- Don't need retraining (edges are edges)
- Saves training time and prevents overfitting

**Step 4: Fine-tune Later Layers**
- Later layers: Task-specific high-level features
- Train on FaceForensics++ dataset
- Learn to detect deepfake artifacts

**Step 5: Data Augmentation**
- Random crops, flips, rotations
- JPEG compression simulation
- Color jittering
- Helps model generalize better

**Dataset: FaceForensics++**
- 5,000 videos (1,000 real + 4,000 fake)
- 4 manipulation types: DeepFakes, Face2Face, FaceSwap, NeuralTextures
- Training time: 2-4 hours on GPU
- Much faster than training from scratch (which needs 100,000+ videos)

## Slide 14: LoRA - Low-Rank Adaptation

### The Model Compression Problem

**The Challenge:**
- EfficientNet-B0: 5.3M parameters
- Full model size: 20 MB
- Fine-tuning updates ALL parameters
- Problem: Want to deploy on edge devices (phones, embedded systems)

**Traditional Solutions:**
- Pruning: Remove unimportant weights (complex, can hurt accuracy)
- Quantization: Use lower precision (INT8 instead of FP32)
- Knowledge distillation: Train smaller student model (time-consuming)

**LoRA's Clever Solution:**
- Don't update original weights W₀ at all (freeze them)
- Add small trainable matrices B and A
- New weights: W = W₀ + BA

**Mathematical Idea:**
```
Original: W₀ ∈ ℝ^(d×k)  (e.g., 1280×1280 = 1,638,400 params)

LoRA decomposition:
B ∈ ℝ^(d×r)  (e.g., 1280×8)
A ∈ ℝ^(r×k)  (e.g., 8×1280)
r ≪ min(d,k)  (rank = 8, much smaller!)

Total LoRA params: r×(d+k) = 8×(1280+1280) = 20,480
Reduction: 1,638,400 / 20,480 = 80× smaller!
```

**Key Insight:**
- Most weight updates during fine-tuning are "low-rank"
- Don't need full matrix, just a small correction
- BA captures this correction efficiently

## Slide 15: LoRA Benefits & Results

### Why LoRA is Powerful

**Compression Results:**
- Original EfficientNet-B0: 5.3M parameters → 20 MB
- With LoRA (rank=8): 150K trainable parameters → 3.5 MB
- **Compression ratio: 35× smaller**
- **Accuracy drop: <1%** (94.5% → 93.5%)

**Key Benefits:**

**1. Edge Deployment**
- 3.5 MB fits easily in mobile/embedded devices
- Can run on-device without internet
- Privacy: Data never leaves device

**2. Multiple Adapters**
- Base model (20 MB) loaded once
- Different adapters for different scenarios:
  - Indoor lighting: +3.5 MB
  - Outdoor lighting: +3.5 MB
  - Different camera: +3.5 MB
- Switch adapters instantly

**3. Faster Training**
- Train only 150K params (not 5.3M)
- 60-70% faster training
- 40-50% less memory needed
- Can train on smaller GPUs

**4. Easy Updates**
- Update just the 3.5 MB adapter
- Don't retrain entire 20 MB model
- Quick iteration and improvement

**Training Process:**
```
1. Load pre-trained EfficientNet-B0
2. Freeze all original weights W₀
3. Add LoRA layers (B, A) with rank r=8
4. Initialize: A randomly, B=0 (so BA=0 at start)
5. Train on dataset for 15 epochs
6. Save only B and A matrices (3.5 MB)
```

**Inference:**
- Compute: output = W₀ × input + B × A × input
- Extra computation: Minimal (0.02B FLOPs added to 0.39B)
- Speed: Nearly identical to original model
